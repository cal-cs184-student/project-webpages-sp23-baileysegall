		<h2>Part 2 Writeup</h2>
		<h3>Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. To do so, pause the simulation at the start with P, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing P again. You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing R</h3>
		
		<h4>Describe the effects of changing the spring constant `ks`; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low `ks`? A high `ks`?</h4>

		<h2>Part 3 Writeup</h2>
		
		<h3>Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from *scene/sphere.json* in its final resting state on the sphere using the default `ks = 5000` as well as with `ks = 500` and `ks = 50000`. Describe the differences in the results.</h3>

		<h3> Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth lying peacefully at rest on the plane. If you haven't by now, feel free to express your colorful creativity with the cloth! (You will need to complete the shaders portion first to show custom colors.)</h3>

		<h2>Part 4 Writeup</h2>
		
		<h3>Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state (even if it is still slightly bouncy on the ground). </h3>
